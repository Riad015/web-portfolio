            <h3>2021-Present | Web developer</h3>
            <p>A post-it note with the question ‚ÄúWhat is a full-stack developer‚Äù written on it has been sitting on my desk for a few weeks. At first, I didn‚Äôt know how to approach the question. I wanted to develop an answer that made sense to anyone new to the arena of web development, but that still touched upon the finer details.

                After all, maybe you are someone interested in making a career change and have repeatedly seen the words ‚Äúfull-stack web developer‚Äù on every technical educational website and job application.</p>
